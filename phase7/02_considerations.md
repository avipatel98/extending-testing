# Performance Testing Considerations

In the previous page we looked at some of the different varieties or types of
performance testing, as well as the motivations behind doing the activity and
what value it can add.

Here we'll look into some of the practicalities around doing performance testing
and what sorts of things a tester may need to consider when planning and
executing performance tests.

The areas a tester is likely to want or need to consider when performance
testing are:

1. Environments
2. Acceptance Criteria
3. Metrics
4. Coverage
5. Using the Information

> Note: here, we won't differentiate between fully-automated performance testing
> and performance testing that's manual (probably with some automated tools to
> add load or monitor metrics). These points apply across all those scenarios,
> but it's still as important as ever to consider what you should be automating
> and when.

Each section starts off with a thought exercise on **load testing** - take a
couple of minutes for each to think through the question and what problems might
exist. The content after will give you the answers to that and talk about
strategies to handle the situation.
