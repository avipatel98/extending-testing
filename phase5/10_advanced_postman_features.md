# Advanced Postman features

We've barely scratched the surface of what's possible in Postman. Depending on 
your workplace, it's possible that you already know everything that you're ever 
going to need to know. But just in case you find yourself in need of further 
features, here are a few other areas of functionality that you might like to 
learn more about:

* The [Collection 
Runner](https://learning.postman.com/docs/running-collections/running-collections-overview/) 
allows you to run all of the requests within a collection/folder in one go. So 
if there are 10 requests that you want to test, you only have to press one button, 
rather than running all 10 of them individually. You can even specify a number of 
iterations, so (for example) if you had a "Create User" endpoint, you could 
ask Postman to run this 50 times to create 50 test users for you.
* [Newman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/running-collections/using-newman-cli/) 
is effectively a command-line version of the Collection Runner. You can program 
it to trigger all of the tests within a collection, and display the results 
(including pass/fail status) into your console. This means that you can 
integrate your Postman tests into your build/CI processes, should you wish.
* [Monitors](https://learning.postman.com/docs/monitoring-your-api/intro-monitors) 
allow you to run requests (or entire folders of request) on a schedule - for 
instance, every night, or triggered externally via Postman's own internal API. 
This means that you can execute associated tests on a recurring schedule, or 
you can utilise the feature to confirm uptime of key parts of your site 
(although there are restriction on how many monitors you can run on the free 
plan).
* [Visualisers](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/visualizer/) 
allow you to apply custom HTML rendering to a response - for example, to 
extract key data from a large JSON response, and present it in an 
easier-to-view format.
* [Mock 
Servers](https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/setting-up-mock/)
allow you to mimic the expected structure of an API (together with dummy 
responses) before it's even been built. This can be useful to help teams to 
quickly iterate on API design, and it gives front-end designers something to 
build against before the back-end has been constructed.

Postman has a large repository of online documentation in the [Postman Learning 
Centre](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/) which 
will allow you to investigate any of these features in further detail.

There is also a dedicated community resource at 
[community.postman.com](https://community.postman.com/) which is maintained by 
staff and power-users, where you can find further assistance with specific 
issues.

## Summary

This concludes our whistle-stop tour around just a handful of Postman's 
functionality. We'll wrap things up by referencing a few other tools which you 
might find useful on your API testing journey.
